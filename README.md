### Commit message format

Please respect the following rules for writing commit messages:

1. One change packet per line. Ideally, one commit only contains only on change
packet.
2. Use the following symbols to convey the specified meaning:
    1. `+` is used for describing *added* features
    2. `*` is used for describing *changed* features and *Bug fixes*
    3. `-` is used for describing *removed* features
3. When using the above symbols, do **not** also describe the meaning by text.
F.e., use `+ filter function to foo` instead of `+ added filter function to foo`
.
